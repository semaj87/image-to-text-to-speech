# Generating text & audio from images

An app that uses Hugging Face AI models to generate text from an image, which then generates audio from the text.

This application uses three steps to complete the above-mentioned task:
* Image to text model to let the machine understand the scenario based upon the content of the photo
* Use an LLM to generate a short story based on the text that was generated in step 1
* Lastly, we will use a text to speech model to generate audio for the story from the LLM
